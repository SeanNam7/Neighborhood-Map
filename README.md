## Directions


## Design notes
<ol>
    <li>I went with a more descriptive data even though it was more difficult to implement because I believe that clear and discriptive data makes it easier to understand the information later on.</li>
    <li>app.js line 81: this.cities = locations
        <ul>
            <li>Due to the way my data is written, ko automatically shows the list of names in my select tag</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
