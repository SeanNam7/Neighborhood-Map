## Directions


## Design notes & sources
<ol>
    <li>I went with a more descriptive data even though it was more difficult to implement because I believe that clear and discriptive data makes it easier to understand the information later on.</li>
    <li>'this.cities = locations' + 'options: cities' + 'optionsText: 'name''
        <ul>
            <li>These three lines allow me to connect the select element with the name of the locations.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>index.html: line 14
